    "## **Step1: Setting-up the Coding Environment and Installing reqirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 1: Installing an Integrated Development Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to have an Integrated Development Environment installed in order to run the code. You can use any IDE of your choice, but I recommend using Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 2: Installing a Programming Language**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Installing python 3.11:**\n",
    "##### <u>*Add deadsnakes PPA for newer Python versions*</u>\n",
    "        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa\n",
    "        sudo apt update\n",
    "\n",
    "##### <u>*Install Python 3.11*</u>\n",
    "        sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev\n",
    "\n",
    "*P.S:This code relies on having the development headers package for it to work. You have to install python3.11 dev*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### <u>*Make the installed version the current python version on your system:*</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "        sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.11 1\n",
    "        sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.11 1\n",
    "\n",
    "A good practice is to install everything in a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will need first to install *virtualenv*:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        pip install virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then you can create your virtual environment of choice and then activate it:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        virtualenv unsloth_env_mar25\n",
    "        source unsloth_env_mar25\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can then install the required dependencies from Unsloth as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "        pip install unsloth vllm # vllm is only available on Linux & Unsloth is build on Cuda Libraries\n",
    "        pip --upgrade pillow\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make sure to install cmake to enable converting the trained model into GGUF at the end of this code\n",
    "\n",
    "        sudo apt install cmake\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 3: Installation of Nvidia Tooklit:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Nvidia Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=22.04&target_type=deb_local) is one of the pillar of this notebook and the finetuning relies on CUDA technology from Nvidia. \n",
    "\n",
    "The version used in this code is 12.4. The code for downloading it is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "        wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu2204.pin\n",
    "        sudo mv cuda-ubuntu2204.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600\n",
    "        wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.4.0/local_installers/cuda-repo-ubuntu2204-12-4-local_12.4.0-550.54.14-1_amd64.deb\n",
    "        sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu2204-12-4-local_12.4.0-550.54.14-1_amd64.deb\n",
    "        sudo cp /var/cuda-repo-ubuntu2204-12-4-local/cuda-*-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/\n",
    "        sudo apt-get update\n",
    "        sudo apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-12-4\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 4: Nvidia CUDA ToolKit and PyTorch Compatibility**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to make sure that the downloaded version of Pytorch by Unsloth is matching the nvidia toolkit that you are downloading from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check using the 2 code blocks below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the versions are different then you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, let's check where both CUDA versions are installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ls -la /usr/local/cuda*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check your current PATH to see which CUDA bin directory comes first:\n",
    "\n",
    "        echo $PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Find all nvcc installations on your system:\n",
    "\n",
    "        which -a nvcc\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Let's modify your shell configuration more thoroughly. Open your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file:\n",
    "\n",
    "       nano ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Add these lines at the end of the file, making sure the paths match your actual CUDA 12.4 installation:\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Remove any existing CUDA paths from PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n",
    "        export PATH=$(echo $PATH | tr ':' '\\n' | grep -v \"cuda\" | tr '\\n' ':' | sed 's/:$//')\n",
    "        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH | tr ':' '\\n' | grep -v \"cuda\" | tr '\\n' ':' | sed 's/:$//')\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Set CUDA 12.4 as default\n",
    "        export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.4\n",
    "        export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH\n",
    "        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Save and close the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Verify the version again:\n",
    "\n",
    "        nvcc --version\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If nvcc still shows 12.6, there might be a system-wide configuration or a symbolic link issue. Let's check:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ls -la /usr/bin/nvcc\n",
    "        ls -la /usr/local/cuda\n",
    "\n",
    "9. If /usr/local/cuda is a symbolic link to /usr/local/cuda-12.6, you can update it to point to 12.4 (requires sudo):\n",
    "\n",
    "        sudo rm /usr/local/cuda\n",
    "        sudo ln -s /usr/local/cuda-12.4 /usr/local/cuda\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 5: Sorting out other dependencies problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **PyTorch Triton failure to compile problem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the solution below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, install the required development packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "        sudo apt-get update\n",
    "        sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make sure libcuda.so is properly installed and accessible:\n",
    "\n",
    "        sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-dev\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can also enable more detailed logging as suggested in the error message:\n",
    "\n",
    "        export TORCH_LOGS=\"+dynamo\"\n",
    "        export TORCHDYNAMO_VERBOSE=1\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 6: Installing Ollama**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ollama is an open-source platform that simplifies running, managing, and creating large language models (LLMs) locally on your machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "It provides an easy way to download and run models like Llama, Mistral, and other open-source LLMs with minimal setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install Ollama on Linux, open a terminal and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "        curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n",
    "\n",
    "This single command downloads and runs the installation script, which sets up Ollama as a service on your system. \n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, you can start using Ollama immediately with commands like ***ollama run llama3*** to download and run models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ollama handles all the model downloading, caching, and configuration automatically, making it one of the simplest ways to experiment with LLMs locally without dealing with complex dependencies or environment setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 7: Installing Open WebUI**\n",
    "\n",
    "Open WebUI is a user-friendly web interface designed to work with Ollama and other LLM backends, providing a ChatGPT-like experience for interacting with locally hosted models. \n",
    "\n",
    "It offers features like chat history, model switching, and parameter adjustments through an intuitive interface. To install Open WebUI on Linux, you can use Python's pip package manager with this simple command:\n",
    "\n",
    "        pip install open-webui\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, you can start the web interface by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "        open-webui serve\n",
    "\n",
    "Once launched, Open WebUI will be accessible through your web browser at http://localhost:8080. \n",
    "\n",
    "This interface connects to your local Ollama instance automatically (if running), allowing you to chat with your downloaded models through a clean, modern interface without needing to use command-line tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open WebUI enhances the experience of working with local LLMs by providing conversation management, sharing capabilities, and easy configuration options in a familiar chat interface."

    "The Generalized Reward-Parametrized Optimization (GRPO) approach is an advanced RLHF technique that trains the model to maximize multiple reward signals simultaneously. This implementation:\n",
    "1. <u>Combines Multiple Objectives</u>: The model learns to balance format adherence, reasoning structure, and answer correctness through the prioritized reward functions.\n",
    "2. <u>Uses TorchDynamo Compilation</u>: The verbose logging helps track the compilation and optimization of training operations for debugging and performance tuning.\n",
    "3. <u>Applies Efficient Learning</u>: By using the previously configured LoRA adapters, the training process updates only a small subset of parameters, making the fine-tuning process much more efficient.\n",
    "4. <u>Progressive Reward System</u>: The reward functions are arranged in order of increasing importance - from basic formatting to exact answer matching - guiding the model to develop both proper structure and accurate content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This RLHF approach trains the model to not only provide correct answers but to follow a specific reasoning-then-answer format that enhances explainability and trustworthiness of the model's outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Configuration Details**\n",
    "This configuration balances performance and efficiency for RLHF training:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision Optimization:**\n",
    "* Automatically selects bfloat16 or fp16 based on hardware support\n",
    "* Uses 8-bit optimizer to reduce memory footprint\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance Settings:**\n",
    "* vLLM backend enables faster inference during training\n",
    "* Small batch size with option to increase gradient accumulation steps\n",
    "* Generates 6 candidate responses per prompt for reward comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Stability:**\n",
    "* Cosine learning rate schedule with 10% warmup period\n",
    "* Gradient clipping at 0.1 to prevent divergence\n",
    "* Weight decay for regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resource Management:**\n",
    "* Configurable token length limits for inputs and outputs\n",
    "* Option to reduce generations if facing memory constraints\n",
    "* Fixed number of training steps rather than epochs for predictable runtime\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "Through my studies and work experience, I have gained a solid foundation in the principles and practices of planning and development. I understand the role of the UK planning system in regulating land use and development, and the key policy frameworks at national and local levels that guide decision-making. I am familiar with the main stages of the development process, from site identification and feasibility assessment to planning application, construction, and disposal. I appreciate the importance of effective stakeholder engagement and community consultation in securing planning consents and social value. I am aware of the various planning mechanisms and tools available, such as Section 106 agreements, Community Infrastructure Levy, and viability assessments, and their impact on development economics. I also recognize the increasing focus on sustainable and inclusive development, with concepts such as biodiversity net gain, social value, and health impact assessments becoming more prominent in the planning process. \n",

A contractor was procured at an early stage and the project started with the necessary design aspects. The outstanding design portions progressed as the project proceeded. There was a quality risk, but it was accounted for in the risk register. I also advised the client to retain the current design team as the technical advisors to make sure that the contractor design is in line with the Employer Requirements (ERs). This helped decrease the quality risks on the client side. \n",

I advised the council on using a Single-Stage Design and Build procurement route which enables the early involvement of the successful contractor. We had a long-standing relationship with the council and my current firm/one of the firms I used to work for had the chance to be the engineering team developing the ERs. Upon the receipt of the tenders, I discovered that one of the two tenderers based their price on a steel frame in lieu of the concrete frame stated in the ERs. This increased the cost of the substructure, superstructure, and upper floors dramatically leading to an imbalance between the tenders. I contacted that tenderer to confirm that they did not follow the ERs, and they confirmed that they were comfortable with their design. I compiled a tender report highlighting the allowances that I measured in the cost plan and the tenders from the two contractors. I notified the client in the tender report about the difference in cost between the two contractors in the substructure, superstructure, and upper floors. I advised the client to proceed with the contractor who followed the ERs as they provided the better quality and the most economically advantageous tender when compared to the other contractor. \n",

      "On a £120M infrastructure project, I provided strategic advice on the procurement and tendering strategy to achieve the client's objectives of risk transfer, cost certainty, and stakeholder engagement. After conducting a detailed analysis of market conditions and benchmarking similar projects, I recommended a hybrid approach combining elements of design and build, target cost, and alliance contracting. For the tunneling package, I advised on a two-stage tender process with an initial prequalification phase focused on technical capability and collaborative working. I developed bespoke tender evaluation criteria incorporating price, quality, and social value metrics, with a 60% weighting on quality to prioritize long-term performance. I also advised on the inclusion of a pain/gain share mechanism and KPI-linked incentives to align contractor and client interests. During the tender process, I led clarification meetings and negotiations with bidders, securing a 5% reduction in the target cost and a commitment to 25% local employment.

      "On a commercial project Order of Cost Estimate, I advised the Client about material and cost benefits of using steel over concrete frames for the entrance lobby area of the building. The Client wanted to have a frame to create an attractive entrance lobby and had a short programme for this scheme. I was able to discuss both design options with the structural engineer and show the Client a side-by-side comparison of having a steel or concrete frame with advantages and disadvantages. Through this analysis I was able to demonstrate and advice that although steel would be more expensive than concrete it would suit the requirements of the project, be more aesthetically pleasing and can be erected much quicker than concrete. As this study was carried out during the pandemic, I also advised them of the supply chain issues and fluctuating steel prices.\n",

I prepared an Order of cost estimate and a life cycle costing model for both options. I advised the Client that from a commercial perspective, it would be more beneficial if they were to demolish the existing building and rebuild the center as opposed to retrofitting the existing old building. Even though retrofitting option had a lower CAPEX, over the lifetime of the building the rebuilding option would provide the council with a higher income and greater use of space which would offset the higher initial costs.

I was acting as the commercial manager of that work package, so I organised a meeting with the client and our technical team in order to discuss and define the client needs and expectations. After analysing the meeting outcome, I advised the client that a traditional route was the best option for this study as it was made clear that price certainty and quality were the two top client priorities. On top of that, that study included an innovative approach hence client wanted to retain control over design and specifications, ensuring their Intellectual Property Rights. Due to those innovative elements of the study, I advised the client that we should allocate the scoring weights in a way to ensure that the outcome of the study is based on validated processes but also completed on the desired price range. Therefore, the scoring for the assessment of this tender was based on 60% for the technical section and 40% for the commercial section. Regarding the actual tender process, I drafted and sent out a Pre- Qualification Questionnaire to several potential tenderers before deciding the final shortlist of tenderers that were invited on that single stage tender. During the tendering process, I was responsible to answer any queries regarding commercial issues. After the tender return and the finalisation of the scoring, I drafted and issued to the client a tender report with my recommendations. \n",

      "On a £35M hotel and spa development, I was responsible for preparing monthly cost reports and managing the change control process. I implemented a bespoke reporting system that tracked costs against individual revenue centers (rooms, restaurants, spa facilities) to assist the operator's business planning. I maintained detailed records of all variations, particularly focusing on the specialist spa equipment and treatment room specifications which were subject to frequent client changes. Through regular cost monitoring and early warning of potential overspend in the spa fit-out package, I identified the need for value engineering options that ultimately saved £450,000 while maintaining the desired guest experience quality. I also prepared monthly cashflow forecasts that helped the client manage their funding drawdown requirements with their bank. \n",

      "A motorway project that I worked on was performed under the NEC3 ECC Option C, including bespoken Z clauses. Due to the existence of one of those Z clauses, I advised the client about how the pain share mechanism should be applied in this particular project, as it was different from the default process in the unamended contract. The main difference was that instead of waiting until the project completion, the contractor was obliged to start his contribution to the pain share right after the contractor spend would exceed the amended contractor budget due to the implementation of compensation events. \n",
      "On a high speed rail infrastructure project, during the procurement process for undertaking a geotechnical study for monitoring the surface movements, I advised the client that the most suitable contract for that task was the NEC3 PSC Option A, which is a priced contract with an activity schedule. That advice was followed by my understanding that client top priorities were price certainty and simplified administration. That option would secure the contract price, transfer the price risk to the supplier and simplify the payment process as it would be linked to the defined activities on the activity schedule. I also advised both the client and the consultant about the importance of having an activity schedule which would be split into well-defined activities in order to allow periodical payments to the supplier after the completion of each activity. In a different occasion for the same project, when I was responsible for compiling a subconsultant agreement for a new supplier, I advised the client that a deviation from the default “back-to-back” contract should be applied, as the level of insurance of the original contract was not possible to be matched by the appointed subconsultant. \n",

I worked with the design team to optimize the building fabric specification, calculating embodied carbon impacts of different materials and presenting lifecycle cost comparisons. When value engineering was required, I protected key sustainability features by demonstrating their long-term financial benefits, including reduced operational costs and enhanced letting potential.

I worked with the M&E engineers to quantify the impact on BREEAM credits and prepared a cost-benefit analysis that demonstrated a 7-year payback period for the enhanced sustainability features. This analysis helped secure additional funding from the university's sustainability budget. \n",

On a recent £50M commercial office development, I led the development and implementation of a comprehensive sustainability strategy aligned with the BREEAM 'Excellent' standard. This involved close collaboration with the design team to optimize the building fabric, services, and renewable energy systems, achieving a 40% reduction in operational carbon emissions compared to Building Regulations. I also worked with the contractor to implement sustainable construction practices, including the use of low-carbon materials, waste reduction initiatives, and a site-wide biodiversity enhancement scheme. I developed a bespoke sustainability dashboard to track key performance indicators and report progress to stakeholders, ensuring accountability and transparency. Alongside this, I have played a key role in driving sustainability reporting and benchmarking within my organization, contributing to the development of our annual sustainability report in line with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards.

      "While working on a £30M hospital refurbishment project, I implemented comprehensive financial control procedures including monthly cost reporting and change management protocols. I developed a detailed cost reporting template that tracked expenditure against budget for 35 separate cost centers, including specialist medical equipment packages. I maintained a change control register documenting 87 variations totaling £2.1M, ensuring each was properly valued and authorized before implementation. Monthly cost reports included detailed analysis of risk allowance utilization, anticipated final cost projections, and cash flow forecasts. I also monitored the expenditure of provisional sums (£1.8M) for asbestos removal works, ensuring proper substantiation of costs. When trend analysis identified potential overspend in the mechanical services package, I implemented additional controls including weekly cost reviews with the contractor, successfully bringing the package back within budget parameters. \n",

      "During my undergraduate degree at and my M.Sc. degree, I studied the basic principles of contract law, and I was made aware of the conditions that make a construction contract legally binding. Moreover, I had the chance to know the outline of different forms of contracts such as FIDIC, JCT, and NEC. I understand the main key differences between JCT and NEC. I have basic knowledge about the benefits of using standard forms of contract. Working for my current firm/one of the firms I used to work for allowed me to develop a further understanding of JCT different forms as well as the basic roles and responsibilities in the JCT SBC form.

I know they're used to assess if a development is financially viable by looking at things like the gross development value, construction costs, fees, and profit. The residual method is often used, where you estimate the GDV using comparables and then deduct costs to work out the land value. Sensitivity analysis is important to see how changes in things like sales values or build costs affect the appraisal. There's RICS guidance on development appraisals, and they play a role in planning applications.

I developed a detailed risk register categorizing risks according to probability and impact, with specific focus on guest disruption and business continuity. I monitored 47 identified risks weekly, tracking mitigation measures and residual risk values. I quantified potential cost impacts using three-point estimating, allowing for optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic scenarios. When asbestos was discovered during bathroom renovations, I coordinated with the project team to revise the risk assessment, implementing additional controls and resequencing works to minimize impact. I maintained detailed records of all risk workshops and mitigation measures, ensuring clear audit trails for insurance purposes.

      "In a school refurbishment project, I participated in the preparation of a stage 4 cost plan for a grade II listed building using NRM 2. The cost plan had to be very detailed to provide a higher level of cost certainty. The nature of works required to be measured included stone, windows, and floor repairs as well as major and minor demolitions. I have measured the MEP package and reviewed all packages with a Senior Quantity Surveyor. For the pricing part, I used prices from suppliers and previous cost plans. For inflation, I used the tender price index from the Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) to establish the uplift for construction cost. Floor and MEP surveys were old, so I had to include provisional sums to account for unforeseen events. I used old projects of a similar nature to be able to estimate the amount of provisional sums to be included. I advised the client that provisional sums have to be included because of the age of the surveys and that once surveys are done; higher price certainty is possible. \n",

I also advised the client that further structural design development was required. The time was of the essence for the client, so they decided to go to tender with this set of drawings while bearing the potential risks. Surveys showed that the soil bearing capacity was less than that designed for. I was involved in design workshops where I liaised with the Design team to advise on the commercial impact of the change in the design of the foundation (raft vs. pad foundation).

The contractor proposed using pad foundations at a depth of 750mm or strip foundation at a depth of 450mm. I liaised with the design team to discuss the suitability of each option. Following my discussions with the design team, I was able to advice my Client by providing a side-by-side cost comparison of both foundation options and presented the design team recommendation of strip foundation at a depth of 450mm as they were more cost efficient and sufficiently designed to withstand the loads imposed on it.

      "In a private housing project, due to the bad performance of one of the subcontractors, the Project Director wanted to terminate the subcontract. Upon investigating the root cause, I found out that he had cash problems that hindered the execution process. I advised the Project Director to supply the material with back charging the costs on the Subcontractor invoices instead of terminating the subcontract. I highlighted that terminating the subcontract for default would result later in issues related to Decennial Liabilities under the country of practice Civil Code. The solution was implemented in a form of an amendment to the subcontract agreement. This resulted in reducing the forecasted time for completion, saving costs compared to terminating the subcontract, and elimination of dividing the liabilities between subcontractors. \n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "During my time at my current firm/One of the firms where I worked , the importance of risk has always been highlighted. Project risks are highlighted and reviewed on specific documents such as risk registers. These registers can relate to various risks from health and safety to financial loss. Risks are assigned owners to manage the risk and note mitigation plans in place to avoid them occurring. Mitigation strategies may include other forms of design to avoid the risk or creating a contract variation to explore another element. The choice of procurement route on projects influences how risk is managed by the Client. For example, if a traditional procurement route is chosen then the Client retains design responsibility. A design and build procurement route means that the risk is borne by the Contractor but there is the potential there could be potential conflict between the Employer Requirements and the Contractor Proposals which may result in additional cost to the Client. During my university course I studied different types of risk matrix and how they calculated a risk rating using likelihood of that risk occurring versus the impact. \n",

I also established a robust risk monitoring and reporting framework, with regular risk reviews and dashboard reporting to the project board. When a major risk event occurred, with the discovery of significant archaeological remains on site, I led the rapid development and implementation of a mitigation strategy, engaging with local heritage bodies and redesigning the scheme to minimize impact while maintaining commercial viability.

      "In an airport project that I worked on, the project was procured under Design and Build with an early contractor appointment. The initial design was over budget, so I was involved as the contractor QS during the schematic design stage to advise on alternative options to reduce the unnecessary costs without affecting the value objectives.\n",
      "I analysed the employer requirements, the concept design layouts, and the previous cost plan. I reconciled with the previous cost plan, and I identified that the cost allowance for the wet services system, which was used to provide the airplanes with potable water and drain the sewage water through a pit system with underground pipes, was over budget and would lengthen the programme due to the high level of coordination needed in the airside.\n",
      "So, I advised the project team to consider changing the current design and replacing the wet services system from the pit system to the ground equipment system (Aircraft Services Trucks), which will provide the same function as an all-stainless-steel unit for servicing aircraft potable water, lavatory system. These will achieve the same functionality with no underground works in the airside or coordination with other infrastructure utilities and shall be compatible with the performance specification prepared by the Employer teams and the international codes.\n",
      "Then I was able to price the new design proposal through supplier quotations. Finally, I have compared the time & cost impact with the previous option and advised the employer to proceed with my proposal. The overall project programme was reduced, and the cost allowance was decreased by about 20% less than the initial design.\n",
      "The employer accepted my proposal and instructed the design team to proceed.\n",
      "In the construction of an office buildings project , my company sought my advice on the cost impact of an additional server room inside one building. I had to advise them about the impact on the mechanical design and cost and make them realize that it was much more than just adding a few racks. I explained that other systems were required, including an air conditioning system dedicated to server rooms , a firefighting system , an uninterruptible power supply system (UPS), and condensate drain pipes under the raised floor. These systems require dedicated panels, cables, and power outlets, thus increasing costs. \n",

I undertook a cost comparison exercise, where I identified the potential cost savings of reducing the deck width for each viaduct after removing one or even both evacuation walkways. The main benefits were found in the areas of the deck and the abutments, where less concrete, reinforced steel and post-tensioned steel would be required. Additional savings could be made by the reduction of formworks and earthworks, as the overall width of the viaduct would be reduced too. The scheme design contained 22 viaducts with the same width but different length and depths. The potential cost saving by removing one walkway was approximately £7m and by removing two was about £14m. My cost exercise, along with technical assurances from the design lead, were recorded formally as a cost saving opportunity for further consideration in the detailed design stage, with the caveat that further multidisciplinary studies may be required to accurately assess the safety and maintenance consequences of removing evacuation walkways from viaducts. \n",

      "On a small residential scheme, due to the Contractor entering into a Compulsory Voluntary Agreement (CVA) midway through the Construction programme it was important that my monthly reports clearly displayed to the Client any risk that they were exposed to with a Contractor working on site that was insolvent. To do this my monthly cost reports also included a section to cover items where the Client had made advance payments to the Contractor prior to my involvement, it also included a summary of Client direct orders. This enabled me to effectively advise the Client of the Construction packages that had the highest risk exposure in the case that the Contractor went into liquidation. Ultimately my reporting was used to help inform the Client decisions with regards to mitigating any further risk exposure. With my fortnightly reporting, the Client could manage direct costs and forecast any cost outlay for future direct orders.

      "On a £180M data center development, I implemented robust financial control and reporting processes that were critical to the successful delivery of the project within budget and client expectations. I developed a bespoke cost reporting dashboard in Power BI, integrating real-time data from site activities, procurement commitments, and contract variations. This provided a single source of truth for project financial performance, enabling proactive identification and management of cost variances and trends. I also established rigorous change control procedures, ensuring that all variations were properly evaluated, approved, and tracked against contingency budgets. Through forensic analysis of subcontractor claims and effective negotiation, I achieved a 10% reduction in the final account settlement compared to the initial assessment. I also introduced a value engineering log to capture and monitor cost saving initiatives, delivering a total of £3.5M in realized savings. My monthly cost reports and cashflow forecasts provided clarity and confidence to the client, facilitating informed decision-making and effective budgetary management. \n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "Whilst working on a project related to the restoration of a historical building, the cost plan at RIBA stage 3 was in excess of the client budget. Design workshops were set up with each discipline (Architectural, Structural, MEP and Landscape) which I attended and chaired. For each discipline there were value engineering solutions that I suggested before scope reduction / omission options were potentially considered. Within the architectural package I reviewed the potential savings available in alternative floor finishes and build ups to the East Court. Originally specified was a brick paver system with a relatively intricate pattern which was costly in material and very labour intensive. Due to the level of fabric repair that was being carried out on the building there was a large quantum of scaffold boards on site. The suggestion of using scaffold boards as part of the East Court floor finish (more in line with the historic finish that was present previously) was suggested and after I reviewed the potential saving of this option and the design team discussed this finish with the public authority responsible for historical buildings, the client and a flooring contractor, a negative provisional sum of -£100k was incorporated into the contract and this negative provisional sum has been achieved during the construction phase. A similar value of cost saving was achieved in the lighting package. I produced a full schedule of lighting fittings on an individual fitting and location basis. From this, I could discuss procurement options with the client based on the cost saving associated with direct engagement with suppliers. I could also package specific areas, such as green rooms for sponsorship. Through this exercise the lighting package was significantly reduced without any significant lowering of performance specification. \n",

      "At a hydropower dam project, the subcontractor design for the employees’ gym was based on a concrete solid slab structure. Since, I knew that this structure will probably be removed upon the project completion, I suggested to the technical director to consider a truss steel structure. I highlighted the cost benefits of adopting a steel structure such as selling it to the client for storage purposes during the operation and maintenance period of the dam, or transferring it to another project within the country, or selling it to steel manufacturers. The solution was implemented due to its future possible cost benefits  . \n",

Since this project was located in quite a remote area, I suggested to the development manager to consider using prefabricated elements such as slabs and walls . I advised that based on our successful execution of prefabricated buildings at a previous private residential project, this solution shall come with many benefits, such as overall cost reduction of the initially estimated budget while controlling the quality of the constructed buildings (the contractor scope will be limited to transportation and installation only), when compared to in-situ concrete casting. The solution was accepted and resulted in reducing the budget of the project to circa 20%;  similar to projects in the nearest big city.  \n",

      "At a Hydropower dam project, there was a debate between the client and the contractor regarding the interpretation of the 2115 MW stated in the client requirements. On one hand, the client interpreted this as the installed capacity, while the contractor represented by me, the contracts and the technical departments, argued that this shall be construed as output capacity. Since the interpretation was not mentioned under any of the contract documents, and the contract was regulated under the laws of UK, I relied on the contra proferentem rule; words shall be construed against the draftsman. After several negotiations, the client insisted on redesigning the dam to have an installed capacity of 2115 MW. The contractor design team proposed two solutions. The first one was to increase the height of the dam and the width of its body. The second one was to change the diameters of the pipes and use a smoother material in the inner outlay of the pipe transferring the water to the generators. I sent the proposals for quotations by the piping supplier and the contractor leading the civil works. Upon receiving both quotations, I concluded that the second option would cost around 55M USD, almost 60M USD less than the first option. I arranged a meeting for both parties to settle this dispute. I also highlighted that the first solution would require a significant extension of time. The Client decided to adopt the second solution while bearing its cost. I drafted the agreement which constituted an amendment to the contract. \n",

Since the Contractor scope of work included 30 years of Operation and Maintenance (OM) of the monorail, all the changes/variations were discussed with the OM team. When discussing the cost impacts of such proposal, it was revealed that savings in the mechanical parts of the MT, in addition to MT paper would be achieved throughout the 30 years period.

      "For a £90M laboratory facility, I provided strategic procurement advice that was crucial to the project's success. After analyzing the client's key drivers of program certainty, flexibility for late user changes, and specialized technical requirements, I advised against their initial preference for a traditional procurement route. Instead, I recommended a two-stage design and build approach with an advance works package for groundworks. I supported this recommendation with a detailed analysis comparing procurement routes against weighted criteria including risk transfer, cost certainty, and flexibility for user input. The analysis demonstrated that a two-stage approach would reduce program risk by 8 weeks and allow early contractor involvement in complex laboratory specifications. I structured the first-stage tender documentation to focus on preliminaries, overheads and profit, with a robust mechanism for converting second-stage packages to fixed prices. This approach successfully delivered the project 3 weeks ahead of schedule, with specialist laboratory installations completed within budget. When some specialist equipment suppliers went into administration mid-project, my procurement strategy's flexibility allowed for swift replacement without program impacts. \n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "During a £25M school project, I undertook detailed quantity take-offs following NRM2 principles for the Stage 4 cost plan. I used CostX software to measure complex elements including curved roof structures and bespoke joinery items, ensuring accurate quantification through digital model validation. For the sports hall, I prepared detailed comparisons of different roofing systems, measuring alternates for glulam beams versus steel trusses. When the contractor proposed value engineering changes to the external works package, I re-measured the affected areas using digital terrain models to precisely calculate earthworks volumes. I also measured detailed quantities for mechanical and electrical installations, working closely with services engineers to ensure all primary and secondary containment was properly accounted for. My measurements were used to successfully negotiate a £180,000 reduction in the contractor's variation claim for additional groundworks. \n",

I recommended the implementation of a two-stage procurement strategy with an early contractor involvement phase specifically focused on buildability and logistics planning. This approach allowed us to reduce the risk contingency from £12M to £8M while improving certainty of delivery.

      "On a project related to the restoration of a historical building, the level of site discoveries within the existing building is very high and existing reports, surveys and as built drawings are often incorrect. Because of this, the level of post contract variations is significantly higher than that of a typical standard building contract with quantities. This level of change control resulted in myself making the decision that cost reports would need to be issued to the client and client team on a fortnightly basis as opposed to a monthly basis. By updating the Change Request Process (CRP) register on a fortnightly basis with a combination of contractor estimates, my own estimates and general risk allowances, I could advise the client the most up to date financial position on a more regular basis. I was advised the client on potential Value Engineering, Sponsorship and Direct Procurement which could offset against the expenditure on the construction contingency. I have also produced a global financial summary which tracks the West Storage Yard project, the enabling works final account, the PCSA fee and the Main Works anticipated final account.

To ensure the rates comparability, I used the BCIS All-in Tender Price Index and BCIS location factor for aligning them to the same base date and location respectively. After that, I checked and challenged the indirect works, by ensuring that the staff levels and the duration of the activities were reasonable outlined in the programme. I also checked and challenged the quantification of the risks and the calculation of the schedule of other costs (land acquisition, environmental mitigations, statutory undertakers, etc). The final output of my cost assurance review was a report which outlined the methodology that I followed as well as my findings and recommendations. \n",

      "While working on a £75M mixed-use development, I provided strategic cost advice that significantly influenced the project's design development. When the initial Stage 3 cost plan exceeded the budget by £8.2M, I led a value engineering exercise analyzing the cost drivers. I advised the client that the curved glazed facade was contributing disproportionately to the cost, presenting detailed cost breakdowns comparing alternative solutions. My analysis demonstrated that modifying the curve radius and utilizing a standardized unitized system would save £2.8M without compromising the architectural intent. I also identified that changing the basement construction methodology to secant piles would save £1.5M and reduce program risk. Following a series of design team workshops, I produced a detailed options appraisal incorporating lifecycle costs and construction program implications. This enabled the client to make informed decisions about design modifications, ultimately bringing the project within budget while maintaining the key design objectives. The success of this approach led to the client adopting similar early-stage cost planning protocols on subsequent projects. \n",

I also set up a robust system for monitoring and reporting on risks, with regular reviews and dashboard reports provided to the project board. When a significant risk occurred, with the discovery of important archaeological remains on site, I quickly developed and implemented a plan to mitigate the risk, working with local heritage organizations and redesigning the scheme to minimize impact while still maintaining commercial viability.

      "Through my university studies and subsequent professional training, I have acquired a solid foundation in the principles and techniques of development appraisals. I understand the purpose of development appraisals in assessing the financial viability of proposed schemes, and the key components of an appraisal, including gross development value (GDV), construction costs, professional fees, and developer's profit. I am familiar with the residual valuation method commonly used in development appraisals, whereby the GDV is estimated based on comparable evidence, and costs are deducted to arrive at the residual land value. I appreciate the importance of sensitivity analysis in testing the impact of changes in key variables, such as sales values, build costs, and finance rates. I am aware of the relevant RICS guidance, such as the Financial Viability in Planning guidance note, and the role of development appraisals in the planning process. I also recognize the limitations of development appraisals, and the need to consider wider factors such as market demand, planning risk, and construction feasibility. \n",

      "During the early commencement stages of the construction period of an Airport project that I worked on, I was the contractor QS, participating in the preparation of the monthly cash flow forecast by doing the mechanical services part to manage the payment due dates for the project. I faced a negative cash flow position at the end of the month; the client payment was based on interim payments of the actual work done on-site plus materials on site. By investigating the cash-out, I identified that the buried valves package was underestimated during the tendering process, as the price was estimated based on the company pricing database. So, I advised the estimation department to avoid such future pitfalls and obtain quotations from suppliers to meet the employer requirements.\n",

      "At a private housing Project, I noticed that all the contractor contracts were based on the FIDIC Red Book 1999. However, when I checked the contract documents, I could not find a referral or a definition to the method of measurement. This means that Sub-Clause 12.2 [Method of Measurement] applies. I highlighted to my line manager that the SC states that “measurement shall be made of the net actual quantity of each item of the Permanent Works…”. meaning that if there is any error during the execution of the works (e.g., additional quantities in the poured concrete in a flat slab), the contractor shall have the right to claim us (Employer Representative) for the additional quantities as they are the actual quantities. Based on that I advised him to add a standard method of measurement as an addendum to all the existing and future contracts. \n",
      "It was agreed under the contract of a private housing project to use the existing excavated soil in the filling process, however during execution, the client induced a variation requiring imported soil for two plots (floor area 4500 m2 each) for better soil characteristics.

I carried-out a quantity take off exercise for the plots to be excavated considering the swelling and the compacted volumes of both soil types and I prepared a list of varied items with quantities along with the estimated time for the process.

      "On a residential scheme that I worked on, this project was a Standard JCT 2011 that I took over the QS role on 6 months prior to completion. I created a dashboard report which provided greater clarity over the many Contract Instructions and priced Tender Queries that had been issued by the Contractor during the construction period. The client had requested a comprehensive view of every cost that had been spent and was due to be spent up to Practical Completion. Due to the financing process of the scheme I also had to sub-divide these costs, as the Client could request funding from various departments based on the work that was being carried out and my dashboard report needed to reflect this. Using this process, I also documented which Instructions were pending sign off and those that had been instructed. This enabled me to provide the Client with a clear indication of the costs to date alongside the anticipated final account figure. It also meant that there were no unexpected costs raised at later stages as the Client was getting a fortnightly update on the financial position. \n",

      "Through my studies, I gained knowledge about various construction methods and the considerations that should be made for their use depending on the needs of each project. I also learnt about the different plans of work that are used in construction projects. From my work experience, I have anticipated how important it is to have multidiscipline reviews before a significant design change, as changing one part of the design may have major effect on another part and so on. I am also aware of the Modern Methods of Construction, the requirements and the potential benefits of their use especially in large scale projects. \n",

      "On a high speed rail infrastructure project, due to the complexity of this project, I had no direct contact with the client, but I was responsible for preparing the internal monthly cost report for five control accounts with a total value of circa £30 million and report back to our project control lead. That report was tracking any financial movement during the month, explaining the reason behind those movements, and highlighting the programme and cost impact of any formalised instructions to date. \n",
      "On another rail infrastructure project, I was preparing and issuing periodically (every four weeks as per the calendar of the client) financial reports to the client, in order to present where funds were spent to date, the remaining cost until the works completion and how any change or risk may affect the final account. \n",
      "On another rail infrastructure project that I worked on, I joined that project 6 months after its commencement and at that time the only established process was the client assessment of our application for payment (AfP). During the next three months and after understanding better the client needs, I created a cost report which was issued along with our AfP each month and helped the client to identify the monthly expenditures, the cumulative spend to date as well as the forecasted cost until the completion of the project. Moreover, as this contract was based on regularly issued Task Instructions Forms (TIFs), the establishment of a control change process was essential. So, as part of that cost report, I created a change tracker in order to have a record of all the previously issued TIFs but also to highlight any new ones and their effect on the programme and final account of the project. Last item of the cost report was a typical risk register, where any risk identified was recorded and assessed. After further discussions with the client about those opened risks, mitigation actions were decided and implemented. \n",

This was created to inform the Client whether or not to pursue an offer to purchase a parcel of land for a new student development. The driver within my cost to ensure that i was accurately advising the Client, was to reach a cost per bed rate that I had benchmarked from the two previous schemes. Consideration had to be made for the inclusion of a basement and podium slab which neither of the previous developments had. This made it problematic to accurately benchmark certain elements of the build against the previous developments, and meant I had to use different methods/data to obtain these costs. I produced a benchmark analysis report from my Cost Plan to report to the Client the cost impact that the podium and basement construction was having on the overall cost of construction. I used a cost per m2 to clearly advise the Client that it was this element of the build that was causing an overall cost which appeared far higher than the two previous schemes in the area.

I calculated the potential saving that might be realised if these options were accounted for. This resulted in maintaining the feasibility of the scheme. \n",

I challenged the contractor on multiple occasions while having the reasoning behind rejecting the change orders (including the change in the lighting brand, number of external lights for bollards and external LEDs for pathway). I advised the client on the rejection of 9 change orders totalling circa £143k. \n",

      "I put together a student accommodation cost estimate which was based on two previous schemes that my current firm/one of the firms I used to work for had worked on in the area. This was created to inform the Client whether or not to pursue an offer to purchase a parcel of land for a new student development. The driver within my cost to ensure that i was accurately advising the Client, was to reach a cost per bed rate that I had benchmarked from the two previous schemes. Consideration had to be made for the inclusion of a basement and podium slab which neither of the previous developments had. This made it problematic to accurately benchmark certain elements of the build against the previous developments, and meant I had to use different methods/data to obtain these costs. I produced a benchmark analysis report from my Cost Plan to report to the Client the cost impact that the podium and basement construction was having on the overall cost of construction. I used a cost per m2 to clearly advise the Client that it was this element of the build that was causing an overall cost which appeared far higher than the two previous schemes in the area. I had these items listed separately in the level 2 summary so that the Client could easily interpret how these additional works were increasing the overall £/m2. \n",

      "On a rail infrastructure project, I measured and agreed contract sums using the agreed schedule of rates on the bespoke agreement between the client and my current employer/one of the companies that I worked in, under which the project was executed. I also used those rates for valuing and agreed variations on later stages of the project. Moreover, I produced a labour cost plan for the following budget year, in order for the client to secure enough funding for the project. For the volume of hours I used the actual hours worked during the previous year, adjusted on the expected volume of work. For the pricing, I used the contract rates and uplifted them for inflation using price indices from the Office for National Statistics. I also included a risk allowance of 3% on top of the cost estimate value, as that was the average variance between the forecast and actuals throughout the previous year. \n",

      "For a £90M laboratory facility, I provided strategic procurement advice that was crucial to the project's success. After analyzing the client's key drivers of program certainty, flexibility for late user changes, and specialized technical requirements, I advised against their initial preference for a traditional procurement route. Instead, I recommended a two-stage design and build approach with an advance works package for groundworks. I supported this recommendation with a detailed analysis comparing procurement routes against weighted criteria including risk transfer, cost certainty, and flexibility for user input. The analysis demonstrated that a two-stage approach would reduce program risk by 8 weeks and allow early contractor involvement in complex laboratory specifications. I structured the first-stage tender documentation to focus on preliminaries, overheads and profit, with a robust mechanism for converting second-stage packages to fixed prices. This approach successfully delivered the project 3 weeks ahead of schedule, with specialist laboratory installations completed within budget. When some specialist equipment suppliers went into administration mid-project, my procurement strategy's flexibility allowed for swift replacement without program impacts. \n",

I faced a negative cash flow position at the end of the month; the client payment was based on interim payments of the actual work done on-site plus materials on site. By investigating the cash-out, I identified that the buried valves package was underestimated during the tendering process, as the price was estimated based on the company pricing database.

My findings revealed that due to the commissions paid to the Bedouins at site and their control of all materials on site, the prices were 50 - 70% more than the prices of the projects developed in the capital of the country of practice and around 20 – 30% more than the prices in the the nearest big city. Since this project was located in quite a remote area, I suggested to the development manager to consider using prefabricated elements such as slabs and walls . I advised that based on our successful execution of prefabricated buildings at a previous private residential project, this solution shall come with many benefits, such as overall cost reduction of the initially estimated budget while controlling the quality of the constructed buildings (the contractor scope will be limited to transportation and installation only), when compared to in-situ concrete casting. The solution was accepted and resulted in reducing the budget of the project to circa 20%;  similar to projects in the nearest big city.  \n",

      "On a £150M mixed-use development, I provided strategic commercial advice that significantly improved the project's financial outcomes. Through detailed analysis of the procurement strategy, I identified that the client's preference for a single-stage design and build approach exposed them to excessive risk in the current volatile market. I recommended a hybrid approach, using a two-stage tender for the shell and core, with specialist packages let on a construction management basis. This approach allowed early contractor involvement in buildability and value engineering, while maintaining competitive tension for 60% of the contract value. I developed bespoke contract terms to apportion risk appropriately, including fluctuations provisions and a pain/gain share mechanism. When the COVID-19 pandemic caused material shortages and price escalation, I implemented a rigorous change control process, scrutinizing supplier claims and negotiating lump-sum settlements to protect the client's position.

      "During the pre-construction stage on a school expansion project Phase 3 owned by a local authority, I have compiled tender documents, reviewed the tender returns and Contract Sum Analysis. Subsequently I have issued tender reports with the outcome of the review process. Due to last minute changes introduced by the Client, a relatively large number of provisional sums were present on two of the projects. I advised the Client of the potential cost implications and engaged with the Contractor to mitigate the negative impact by agreeing them as ‘defined’ provisional sums where possible and introducing the requirement for competitive tendering (at least three quotes) following design completion (post contract). \n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "In a school refurbishment project, I participated in the preparation of a stage 4 cost plan for a grade II listed building using NRM 2. The cost plan had to be very detailed to provide a higher level of cost certainty. The nature of works required to be measured included stone, windows, and floor repairs as well as major and minor demolitions. I have measured the MEP package and reviewed all packages with a Senior Quantity Surveyor. For the pricing part, I used prices from suppliers and previous cost plans. For inflation, I used the tender price index from the Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) to establish the uplift for construction cost. Floor and MEP surveys were old, so I had to include provisional sums to account for unforeseen events. I used old projects of a similar nature to be able to estimate the amount of provisional sums to be included. I advised the client that provisional sums have to be included because of the age of the surveys and that once surveys are done; higher price certainty is possible. \n",
      "In a Primary School project, the structural drawings incorporated in RIBA Stage 4 did not account for geotechnical surveys for the project site (site surveys were not yet fully completed) but accounted for the site conditions of the surrounding structures to the site. I advised the client that this approach carried risk; as site surveys might show that the soil condition is poor which would result in change orders when the project commences. I also advised the client that further structural design development was required. The time was of the essence for the client, so they decided to go to tender with this set of drawings while bearing the potential risks. Surveys showed that the soil bearing capacity was less than that designed for. I was involved in design workshops where I liaised with the Design team to advise on the commercial impact of the change in the design of the foundation (raft vs. pad foundation). I advised the client of the difference (circa £60k) and advised that this change should be allocated to employer change risks. \n",

      "At the beginning of a residential building project, there was no change control process in the tender documents or the provisions of the bespoke contract. So, I advised parties that a change control strategy needs to be established to alter the existence of any change and report on the impact on cost, programme, and any other criteria. I further advised that the process should be documented and monitored in a change control log after obtaining the employer approval. I followed the same procedures under The Fidic Red Book 1999 and the parties agreed on the implementation, which positively affected the project, helped the employer make decisions, and reduced disputes.\n",

Instead, I developed a detailed risk model that quantified the impact of potential disruption to airport operations, considering factors such as security breaches, passenger flow disruption, and baggage handling system interfaces. I recommended the implementation of a two-stage procurement strategy with an early contractor involvement phase specifically focused on buildability and logistics planning. This approach allowed us to reduce the risk contingency from £12M to £8M while improving certainty of delivery.

      "During my time at my current firm/One of the firms where I worked , the importance of risk has always been highlighted. Project risks are highlighted and reviewed on specific documents such as risk registers. These registers can relate to various risks from health and safety to financial loss. Risks are assigned owners to manage the risk and note mitigation plans in place to avoid them occurring. Mitigation strategies may include other forms of design to avoid the risk or creating a contract variation to explore another element. The choice of procurement route on projects influences how risk is managed by the Client. For example, if a traditional procurement route is chosen then the Client retains design responsibility. A design and build procurement route means that the risk is borne by the Contractor but there is the potential there could be potential conflict between the Employer Requirements and the Contractor Proposals which may result in additional cost to the Client. During my university course I studied different types of risk matrix and how they calculated a risk rating using likelihood of that risk occurring versus the impact. \n",

I am familiar with the key legislation governing the relationship between landlords and tenants, including the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954, the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, and the RICS Code for Leasing Business Premises. I understand the main types of commercial leases, such as full repairing and insuring (FRI), internal repairing and insuring (IRI), and service charge leases, and the implications for each party's rights and obligations. I appreciate the importance of key lease clauses, such as rent review provisions, break options, and dilapidations liability, and the need for careful drafting to protect clients' interests. I am aware of the role of lease advisory services in supporting tenants and landlords, from lease negotiations and renewals to dispute resolution and lease restructuring. I also recognize the growing focus on sustainability and flexibility in commercial leasing, with trends such as green leases and shorter lease terms becoming increasingly prevalent. \n",

      "In a high speed rail infrastructure project, during the process of reviewing the design for identifying cost saving opportunities, I challenged our bridges design lead on the requirement for two evacuation walkways in every single viaduct across the scheme as a default design option. The design lead explained to me that having two evacuation walkways of 0.85m wide at each edge of the viaducts’ deck was necessary for meeting the design standards, but he suggested that I could investigate further and propose that opportunity for future consideration. I undertook a cost comparison exercise, where I identified the potential cost savings of reducing the deck width for each viaduct after removing one or even both evacuation walkways. The main benefits were found in the areas of the deck and the abutments, where less concrete, reinforced steel and post-tensioned steel would be required. Additional savings could be made by the reduction of formworks and earthworks, as the overall width of the viaduct would be reduced too. The scheme design contained 22 viaducts with the same width but different length and depths. The potential cost saving by removing one walkway was approximately £7m and by removing two was about £14m. My cost exercise, along with technical assurances from the design lead, were recorded formally as a cost saving opportunity for further consideration in the detailed design stage, with the caveat that further multidisciplinary studies may be required to accurately assess the safety and maintenance consequences of removing evacuation walkways from viaducts. \n",

      "On a project related to the restoration of a historical building, the level of site discoveries within the existing building is very high and existing reports, surveys and as built drawings are often incorrect. Because of this, the level of post contract variations is significantly higher than that of a typical standard building contract with quantities. This level of change control resulted in myself making the decision that cost reports would need to be issued to the client and client team on a fortnightly basis as opposed to a monthly basis. By updating the Change Request Process (CRP) register on a fortnightly basis with a combination of contractor estimates, my own estimates and general risk allowances, I could advise the client the most up to date financial position on a more regular basis. I was advised the client on potential Value Engineering, Sponsorship and Direct Procurement which could offset against the expenditure on the construction contingency. I have also produced a global financial summary which tracks the West Storage Yard project, the enabling works final account, the PCSA fee and the Main Works anticipated final account. I am also responsible for monitoring the cost of professional fees, fundraising contributions and deferred works items to show the client their full commercial position in a clear and concise manner. \n",

Based on the Client timeline the design would only be at RIBA Stage 2/3 when they wanted to enter into Contract, which I advised would lend itself to a design and build procurement route. However, the Client experience was primarily using a Traditional Procurement route and they wanted to proceed down this route as it is what they were most knowledgeable in. I advised the Client that if they wanted to take this route then they should extend the programme to allow for the design team to develop the design to at least stage 4.

As this development is in addition to previous works carried out on the same site my current firm/one of the firms I used to work for had historical cost data from previous tender returns that could be applied directly to this cost plan to enable a high level of cost certainty. There were however very specialist elements of the build which I was unable to source costs for through historic data and meant I had to go to market leaders who supplied and fit out these areas to get cost advice prior to issuing our updated cost plan.

      "I've learned about corporate real estate through my studies and training. I know it's about aligning property strategies with business goals, considering things like cost, flexibility, and sustainability. Corporate portfolios can include different types of properties, like offices and warehouses, and different ownership or rental arrangements. Effective data management is important for making good decisions, and technology is playing a bigger role. There's also a growing focus on creating workplaces that support employee wellbeing and productivity, with trends like flexible working changing what occupiers need. \n",

      "During the tendering stage of the employees residential area at a hydropower dam project, I knew from the project manager that time and quality were of essence as 1. the construction was directly affected by the season (higher productivity in the dry-season compared to wet-season), and 2. The employees must be transferred to the site. Since we were at the rainy season period, I advised him to proceed with a single stage traditional procurement route to commence the design and manufacturing during the rainy season while finishing the construction in the dry season. The quality issues were controlled through adding the Contractor Requirements to the agreement, in addition to submitting a performance guarantee.\n",
      "While managing Phase 3 of a private housing Project, one of the two major contractors had difficulties during the construction period, which resulted in major delays to the overall progress of the project. Accordingly, I advised the Project Director to adopt Single Stage traditional remeasured procurement route for the newly added Phase 7 with five to seven contractors while giving the complex parts of the project (the university and the hospital building) to the best performing contractor in Phase 3. This is to have a better control on the progress and the allocated budget for Phase 7. \n",

      "In a motorway project I advised the client about delivering value for money on the project and provided them with confidence about the final outturn cost, when I undertook a cost assurance review on the pre-construction estimates, which was submitted by the four Delivery Integration Partners (DIPs). Due to a time constrained assurance window, I produced my review by using a Pareto style analysis focusing on the high value packages of the direct works. After taking off the key quantities from the same set of drawings used by the DIPs, I checked whether my take off matched the submitted ones within a range of +/- 10%. I also assessed the rates used by the DIPs by ensuring that they were comparable to rates from other similar highways projects from our internal cost data library. To ensure the rates comparability, I used the BCIS All-in Tender Price Index and BCIS location factor for aligning them to the same base date and location respectively. After that, I checked and challenged the indirect works, by ensuring that the staff levels and the duration of the activities were reasonable outlined in the programme. I also checked and challenged the quantification of the risks and the calculation of the schedule of other costs (land acquisition, environmental mitigations, statutory undertakers, etc). The final output of my cost assurance review was a report which outlined the methodology that I followed as well as my findings and recommendations. \n",

      "On a high speed rail infrastructure project, the client instructed us to procure and provide a geotechnical study for monitoring the surface movements of a determined project area. I was acting as the commercial manager of that work package, so I organised a meeting with the client and our technical team in order to discuss and define the client needs and expectations. After analysing the meeting outcome, I advised the client that a traditional route was the best option for this study as it was made clear that price certainty and quality were the two top client priorities. On top of that, that study included an innovative approach hence client wanted to retain control over design and specifications, ensuring their Intellectual Property Rights. Due to those innovative elements of the study, I advised the client that we should allocate the scoring weights in a way to ensure that the outcome of the study is based on validated processes but also completed on the desired price range. Therefore, the scoring for the assessment of this tender was based on 60% for the technical section and 40% for the commercial section. Regarding the actual tender process, I drafted and sent out a Pre- Qualification Questionnaire to several potential tenderers before deciding the final shortlist of tenderers that were invited on that single stage tender. During the tendering process, I was responsible to answer any queries regarding commercial issues.

      "In a private housing project, due to the bad performance of one of the subcontractors, the Project Director wanted to terminate the subcontract. Upon investigating the root cause, I found out that he had cash problems that hindered the execution process. I advised the Project Director to supply the material with back charging the costs on the Subcontractor invoices instead of terminating the subcontract. I highlighted that terminating the subcontract for default would result later in issues related to Decennial Liabilities under the country of practice Civil Code. The solution was implemented in a form of an amendment to the subcontract agreement. This resulted in reducing the forecasted time for completion, saving costs compared to terminating the subcontract, and elimination of dividing the liabilities between subcontractors. \n",

The time and cost constraints were the governing factors. That was why I advised the client on using a Single-Stage Design and Build procurement route. A contractor was procured at an early stage and the project started with the necessary design aspects. The outstanding design portions progressed as the project proceeded. There was a quality risk, but it was accounted for in the risk register. I also advised the client to retain the current design team as the technical advisors to make sure that the contractor design is in line with the Employer Requirements (ERs). This helped decrease the quality risks on the client side. \n",

We had a long-standing relationship with the council and my current firm/one of the firms I used to work for had the chance to be the engineering team developing the ERs. Upon the receipt of the tenders, I discovered that one of the two tenderers based their price on a steel frame in lieu of the concrete frame stated in the ERs. This increased the cost of the substructure, superstructure, and upper floors dramatically leading to an imbalance between the tenders. I contacted that tenderer to confirm that they did not follow the ERs, and they confirmed that they were comfortable with their design. I compiled a tender report highlighting the allowances that I measured in the cost plan and the tenders from the two contractors. I notified the client in the tender report about the difference in cost between the two contractors in the substructure, superstructure, and upper floors. I advised the client to proceed with the contractor who followed the ERs as they provided the better quality and the most economically advantageous tender when compared to the other contractor. \n",

I created a dashboard report which provided greater clarity over the many Contract Instructions and priced Tender Queries that had been issued by the Contractor during the construction period. The client had requested a comprehensive view of every cost that had been spent and was due to be spent up to Practical Completion. Due to the financing process of the scheme I also had to sub-divide these costs, as the Client could request funding from various departments based on the work that was being carried out and my dashboard report needed to reflect this. Using this process, I also documented which Instructions were pending sign off and those that had been instructed. This enabled me to provide the Client with a clear indication of the costs to date alongside the anticipated final account figure. It also meant that there were no unexpected costs raised at later stages as the Client was getting a fortnightly update on the financial position. \n",

I am aware of the potential impact of insolvency on construction projects, including the need to assess the financial viability of contractors and the risk of supply chain failure. I also recognize the role of property assets in corporate recovery strategies, such as sale and leaseback transactions or the disposal of non-core assets to raise capital. \n",

      "During a £25M school project, I undertook detailed quantity take-offs following NRM2 principles for the Stage 4 cost plan. I used CostX software to measure complex elements including curved roof structures and bespoke joinery items, ensuring accurate quantification through digital model validation. For the sports hall, I prepared detailed comparisons of different roofing systems, measuring alternates for glulam beams versus steel trusses. When the contractor proposed value engineering changes to the external works package, I re-measured the affected areas using digital terrain models to precisely calculate earthworks volumes. I also measured detailed quantities for mechanical and electrical installations, working closely with services engineers to ensure all primary and secondary containment was properly accounted for.

I prepared an Order of cost estimate and a life cycle costing model for both options. I advised the Client that from a commercial perspective, it would be more beneficial if they were to demolish the existing building and rebuild the center as opposed to retrofitting the existing old building. Even though retrofitting option had a lower CAPEX, over the lifetime of the building the rebuilding option would provide the council with a higher income and greater use of space which would offset the higher initial costs. After reviewing both business cases, the council was able to approve rebuilding the project. \n",

      "While working on a £75M mixed-use development, I provided strategic cost advice that significantly influenced the project's design development. When the initial Stage 3 cost plan exceeded the budget by £8.2M, I led a value engineering exercise analyzing the cost drivers. I advised the client that the curved glazed facade was contributing disproportionately to the cost, presenting detailed cost breakdowns comparing alternative solutions. My analysis demonstrated that modifying the curve radius and utilizing a standardized unitized system would save £2.8M without compromising the architectural intent. I also identified that changing the basement construction methodology to secant piles would save £1.5M and reduce program risk. Following a series of design team workshops, I produced a detailed options appraisal incorporating lifecycle costs and construction program implications. This enabled the client to make informed decisions about design modifications, ultimately bringing the project within budget while maintaining the key design objectives. The success of this approach led to the client adopting similar early-stage cost planning protocols on subsequent projects. \n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "Through a combination of university coursework and self-directed learning, I have developed a foundational understanding of the principles and applications of remote sensing and photogrammetry in the context of surveying and spatial data capture. I am familiar with the main types of remote sensing platforms, including satellites, aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the different sensor types, such as optical, multispectral, and LiDAR. I understand the basic concepts of photogrammetry, such as stereo imagery, bundle adjustment, and point cloud generation, and how these techniques are used to create high-resolution 3D models and digital elevation models (DEMs). I appreciate the potential benefits of remote sensing and photogrammetry in enhancing the efficiency, accuracy, and safety of surveying and mapping activities, particularly in large-scale or hard-to-access environments. I am aware of the key considerations in planning and executing remote sensing surveys, such as resolution requirements, flight planning, and ground control point selection, and the importance of data quality assurance and control. \n",

      "On a £40M hotel refurbishment project, I implemented comprehensive risk management procedures while working in an occupied building. I developed a detailed risk register categorizing risks according to probability and impact, with specific focus on guest disruption and business continuity. I monitored 47 identified risks weekly, tracking mitigation measures and residual risk values. I quantified potential cost impacts using three-point estimating, allowing for optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic scenarios. When asbestos was discovered during bathroom renovations, I coordinated with the project team to revise the risk assessment, implementing additional controls and resequencing works to minimize impact. I maintained detailed records of all risk workshops and mitigation measures, ensuring clear audit trails for insurance purposes. Monthly risk reports tracked the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, showing a 35% reduction in risk exposure over the project duration. \n",

      "In a high speed rail infrastructure project when I was part of the value management team, I was working closely with the geotechnical and bridges design teams in order to identify new opportunities and progress them through the various stages up until their incorporation in the design. An example of that was the production of a cost estimate, as part of a Technical Note, for identifying areas where cost savings (based on cost/km) can be made by replacing embankments with viaducts and vice versa. In addition, I participated into multidiscipline option sifting workshops for selecting better design solutions taking into consideration multiple factors such as construction, operation and maintenance needs, environmental impacts, stakeholders’ requests, cost and programme.

      "At a Hydropower dam project, there was a debate between the client and the contractor regarding the interpretation of the 2115 MW stated in the client requirements. On one hand, the client interpreted this as the installed capacity, while the contractor represented by me, the contracts and the technical departments, argued that this shall be construed as output capacity. Since the interpretation was not mentioned under any of the contract documents, and the contract was regulated under the laws of UK, I relied on the contra proferentem rule; words shall be construed against the draftsman. After several negotiations, the client insisted on redesigning the dam to have an installed capacity of 2115 MW. The contractor design team proposed two solutions. The first one was to increase the height of the dam and the width of its body. The second one was to change the diameters of the pipes and use a smoother material in the inner outlay of the pipe transferring the water to the generators. I sent the proposals for quotations by the piping supplier and the contractor leading the civil works. Upon receiving both quotations, I concluded that the second option would cost around 55M USD, almost 60M USD less than the first option. I arranged a meeting for both parties to settle this dispute. I also highlighted that the first solution would require a significant extension of time. The Client decided to adopt the second solution while bearing its cost. I drafted the agreement which constituted an amendment to the contract. \n",

This approach saved £2.1M compared to the main contractor's proposals. I also advised on restructuring the payment mechanisms for the baggage handling system, implementing milestone payments linked to testing and commissioning to better manage cash flow risk. When material price inflation threatened project viability, I developed a risk-sharing mechanism with key suppliers, incorporating indices-based price adjustment while maintaining cost certainty on 70% of the contract value.

I ran a series of risk workshops with key stakeholders, using a structured approach to identify and assess risks in line with ISO 31000. I created a detailed risk register using ARM software, categorizing risks by likelihood and impact, and developed specific response plans for the most critical risks.

I also set up a robust system for monitoring and reporting on risks, with regular reviews and dashboard reports provided to the project board. When a significant risk occurred, with the discovery of important archaeological remains on site, I quickly developed and implemented a plan to mitigate the risk, working with local heritage organizations and redesigning the scheme to minimize impact while still maintaining commercial viability.

      "Whilst working on a project related to the restoration of a historical building, the cost plan at RIBA stage 3 was in excess of the client budget. Design workshops were set up with each discipline (Architectural, Structural, MEP and Landscape) which I attended and chaired. For each discipline there were value engineering solutions that I suggested before scope reduction / omission options were potentially considered. Within the architectural package I reviewed the potential savings available in alternative floor finishes and build ups to the East Court. Originally specified was a brick paver system with a relatively intricate pattern which was costly in material and very labour intensive. Due to the level of fabric repair that was being carried out on the building there was a large quantum of scaffold boards on site. The suggestion of using scaffold boards as part of the East Court floor finish (more in line with the historic finish that was present previously) was suggested and after I reviewed the potential saving of this option and the design team discussed this finish with the public authority responsible for historical buildings, the client and a flooring contractor, a negative provisional sum of -£100k was incorporated into the contract and this negative provisional sum has been achieved during the construction phase. A similar value of cost saving was achieved in the lighting package. I produced a full schedule of lighting fittings on an individual fitting and location basis. From this, I could discuss procurement options with the client based on the cost saving associated with direct engagement with suppliers. I could also package specific areas, such as green rooms for sponsorship. Through this exercise the lighting package was significantly reduced without any significant lowering of performance specification. \n",

The client had achieved the funds for the project based on a relatively detailed S- curve and the very high-level activity schedule that the contractor submitted would not have conformed to that expected level of output.

Following that, I continued with the calculation of the rest sections of the cost estimate (preliminaries, design fees, other project costs, risks) using again our in-house cost data library as a benchmark. Regarding the inflation cost, I used the BCIS all-in tender price index to calculate both the tender and construction inflation cost. \n",

I facilitated a series of risk workshops with key stakeholders, using a structured risk identification and assessment methodology aligned with ISO 31000. I created a detailed risk register in ARM software, categorizing risks according to likelihood and impact, and developed bespoke risk response plans for critical risks. I introduced quantitative risk analysis techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulation, to model the potential cost and schedule impacts of different risk scenarios and inform contingency planning. I also established a robust risk monitoring and reporting framework, with regular risk reviews and dashboard reporting to the project board. When a major risk event occurred, with the discovery of significant archaeological remains on site, I led the rapid development and implementation of a mitigation strategy, engaging with local heritage bodies and redesigning the scheme to minimize impact while maintaining commercial viability. Through proactive risk management, the project was delivered on time and within 3% of the original budget, with the archaeological risks successfully mitigated and a public archaeology program integrated into the scheme. \n",

      "A motorway project that I worked on was performed under the NEC3 ECC Option C, including bespoken Z clauses. Due to the existence of one of those Z clauses, I advised the client about how the pain share mechanism should be applied in this particular project, as it was different from the default process in the unamended contract. The main difference was that instead of waiting until the project completion, the contractor was obliged to start his contribution to the pain share right after the contractor spend would exceed the amended contractor budget due to the implementation of compensation events. \n",
      "On a high speed rail infrastructure project, during the procurement process for undertaking a geotechnical study for monitoring the surface movements, I advised the client that the most suitable contract for that task was the NEC3 PSC Option A, which is a priced contract with an activity schedule. That advice was followed by my understanding that client top priorities were price certainty and simplified administration. That option would secure the contract price, transfer the price risk to the supplier and simplify the payment process as it would be linked to the defined activities on the activity schedule. I also advised both the client and the consultant about the importance of having an activity schedule which would be split into well-defined activities in order to allow periodical payments to the supplier after the completion of each activity. In a different occasion for the same project, when I was responsible for compiling a subconsultant agreement for a new supplier, I advised the client that a deviation from the default “back-to-back” contract should be applied, as the level of insurance of the original contract was not possible to be matched by the appointed subconsultant. \n",

      "On one of the projects that I worked on, I advised the Client on the cost implications of using one type of foundations over the other for one of the variations submitted by the contractor. The contractor proposed using pad foundations at a depth of 750mm or strip foundation at a depth of 450mm. I liaised with the design team to discuss the suitability of each option. Following my discussions with the design team, I was able to advice my Client by providing a side-by-side cost comparison of both foundation options and presented the design team recommendation of strip foundation at a depth of 450mm as they were more cost efficient and sufficiently designed to withstand the loads imposed on it. The Client appreciated this advice and implemented it saving them approximately £15k.\n",

      "In an educational/residential project, following the issue of the RIBA stage 3 cost plan, the client requested to have a value engineering workshop as the project budget was not feasible for the council. I participated in several value engineering workshops with the design team and the client. After liaising with the design team there was a list of items that I have highlighted based on the pricing of the cost plan: timber balconies, large-sized curtain walls, aluminium doors, glass bricks, zinc cladding and Woodpecker flooring. I compiled a list including these items alongside some potential alternatives I advised the client about including internal wooden doors, brick slips and concrete balconies. I calculated the potential saving that might be realised if these options were accounted for. This resulted in maintaining the feasibility of the scheme. \n",

While reviewing the Final Accounts in conjunction with the Employer Requirements and the CSA, I noticed the contractor had claimed for an extra £20k for the lighting columns.

Due to the nature of the D&B fixed price contract, I advised my Client that they would not need to pay for the extra costs. I also notified the contractor about this and through subsequent negotiations, I was able to resolve the dispute by having this claim excluded from the Final Accounts, thereby saving the Client approximately £20k. \n",

      "On a complex £200M urban regeneration scheme, I developed and implemented a comprehensive risk management strategy that was instrumental in the successful delivery of the project within time, cost, and quality parameters. I facilitated a series of risk workshops with key stakeholders, using a structured risk identification and assessment methodology aligned with ISO 31000. I created a detailed risk register in ARM software, categorizing risks according to likelihood and impact, and developed bespoke risk response plans for critical risks. I introduced quantitative risk analysis techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulation, to model the potential cost and schedule impacts of different risk scenarios and inform contingency planning. I also established a robust risk monitoring and reporting framework, with regular risk reviews and dashboard reporting to the project board. When a major risk event occurred, with the discovery of significant archaeological remains on site, I led the rapid development and implementation of a mitigation strategy, engaging with local heritage bodies and redesigning the scheme to minimize impact while maintaining commercial viability. Through proactive risk management, the project was delivered on time and within 3% of the original budget, with the archaeological risks successfully mitigated and a public archaeology program integrated into the scheme. \n",

The client had achieved the funds for the project based on a relatively detailed S- curve and the very high-level activity schedule that the contractor submitted would not have conformed to that expected level of output. I suggested to split the packages into greater detail as an activity must be 100% finished to be claimed as complete. I advised that the sub structures package was split into piles, ground beams, pile caps, ground floor slab etc. This level of detail as opposed to the original high-level submission ensures that monies could be drawn down on a more realistic time scale which reflects the client expectations (based on their original S-curve).
