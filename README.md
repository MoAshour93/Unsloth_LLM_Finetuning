# Unsloth_LLM_Finetuning
Fine-tune the Llama 3.1 8B model with Unsloth to assist RICS APC candidates, bid managers, CV writers, and Quantity Surveyors. This project creates a domain-specific LLM that generates tailored RICS APC responses, bid drafts, CVs, and codified BoQs, streamlining documentation tasks in the construction industry.
