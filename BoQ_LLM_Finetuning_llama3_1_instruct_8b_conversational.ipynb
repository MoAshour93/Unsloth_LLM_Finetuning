    "On GitHub, **\"Unsloth\"** refers to a library designed to optimize the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) such as **Llama**, **Mistral**, **Phi**, and **Gemma**. The main focus of Unsloth is to accelerate the fine-tuning process and reduce memory usage significantly. Here are some key features of Unsloth:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Performance Improvement:** Unsloth can fine-tune models 2-5 times faster while using 80% less memory. This is achieved through efficient memory management and optimization techniques.\n",
    "* **Compatibility:** It supports most NVIDIA GPUs released since 2018, including popular models like the RTX series and A100. It works on both Linux and Windows via WSL.\n",
    "* **Accuracy:** There is no loss in accuracy as Unsloth uses exact methods rather than approximations.\n",
    "* **Bit Precision Support:** The library supports 4-bit and 16-bit quantization for more efficient model fine-tuning.\n",
    "* **Integration:** Unsloth is compatible with the Hugging Face ecosystem, allowing users to leverage popular libraries like Transformers, PEFT, and TRL.\n",
    "\n",
    "For installation, Unsloth provides detailed instructions for both *Conda* and *Pip*, depending on your setup. It also includes benchmarking data to demonstrate its efficiency compared to traditional methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the Github page for unsloth from the following link: https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth?tab=readme-ov-file"

    "Step 1.1: Windows Subsystem for Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unsloth works only on a linux based system. You can download your preferred linux distribution from the following link: https://www.linux.org/pages/download/. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Alternatively, you can head to the following link : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install to understand how to install Windows Subsystem for Linux on your machine. \n",

    "        wsl --install\n",
    "_________\n",
    "Step 1.2: Anaconda:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The easiest installation of Unsloth relies on installing Conda which is available within Anaconda. To do that, go to Anaconda's main website: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.02-1-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once donwloaded, go to the place where you saved the Anaconda distribtuion. Open the terminal in this location and then  type the following 2 commands :\n",
